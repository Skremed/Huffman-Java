# Huffman-Java
A project I did for DataStructures with java
Java is not my main programming language, so it might be lacking some optimization or other crucial things.

This program is bundled with File explorer I wrote and it can Encrypt and Decrypt your files (The encryption is nothing fancy) and Compress, Decompress your text files (Works for other file types too, but its Huffman so its not the best for anything other than text files).
